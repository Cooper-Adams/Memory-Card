# Memory Card Game

The memory card game is a part of The Odin Project's react curriculum.

Check it out live here.

The guidelines for this project wanted us to grab the images and accompanying text from an API, but for the images I wanted to display here I had no way of doing so. To compensate, I built a small array in the characters.js file that houses the information for each character including a link to the image. While this doesn't equal pulling from an API, I have had prior practice doing so before going through the React course (and will continue to use APIs in the future), so I felt this was an ok substitution.
